## Setup

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm start`

Now you should have a `index.html` file in the `/dist/html/` directory.

## Usage

You can edit the `index.html` file inside `/src/html/`.
After making an edit do run `npm start` to update the files in the `dist` directory.

You can also run `npm run watch` if you dont want to run `npm start` all the time.
This will watch for changes and autorun the command for you.
